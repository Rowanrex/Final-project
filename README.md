Final project for Python
my project will be a game of a cat running from a dog. The cat's goal will be to evade the dog and get home before the rain begins. The cat will be able to pick up tokens along the way.0

The title of my project will likely be 
"Scurry furry"
It will be a game similar to temple run of a cat dashing from a dog. The cat's goal is to get home before the rain or before it is caught.
The game will be completed using Pygames. The program will be 2-D. It will feature a dog and a cat as moving parts. The cat will be able to pick up tokens along its run. If the cat is caught by the dog or is not home before the rain begins, the game will end.
No matter what the cat will be running from the dog, and the game will end if caught.
A better outcome would be that the cat must also get home before it begins to rain. 
The best outcome would be all of the above as well as the ability for the cat to pick up tokens and power ups.
I will need to research game design. I will also need to research how to add power ups and tokens. I will research games like subway surfer and temple run for inspiration.
